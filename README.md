# go-webapp

This is a simple web application in Go that provides basic CRUD operations on a database. It is intended primarily as an excercise for teaching myself the language.

# Conditions

This app will use the free test dataset from https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db. 

# Milestones

## M0: Database installed

SQLite database has been created with employee data

## M1: Read

Application can display an arbitrary record by ID

## M2: Search

Application can search for a given record

## M3: List

Application can list all records

## M4: Update

Application can update existing records

## M5: Create

Application can create new records

## M6: Delete

Application can delete existing records

## M7+: ???

Anything that I think would be cool. Maybe doing some analysis stuff, maybe looking for outliers in the data set, I don't know.
